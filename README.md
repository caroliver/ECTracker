The code for this project codes for a calorie counter, calories calculator, and exercise schedule creator app. It allows an individual to create a user if they are new to the system, or log in if they have already created a user by running the user information from a .csv file into the program then using the login command. It then allows the user to update/change their username, password, or email if they desire. One of the main functions of the code is the calorie counter that allows the user to create an initial calorie counter for the day, as well as add additional calories throughout the day. It the provides the user with the option to reset the calorie counter to 0 whenever they choose. The second main function provides the user with a specific schedule depending on the type of exercise (cardio or weight), their fitness level (1-beginner to 3-fit), and the choice of what type of weight or cardio exercise they would like to do. The final main function of the code is the calorie calculator. The calculator calculates how many calories the user needs to eat per day to attain their goal weight based on the users current dailey calorie intake, current weight, days they wish to diet, and goal weight. All of which are entered by the user when they choose to use the calorie calculator. The code also throws exceptions when necessary, uses FileIO to keep track of the users information in an external csv file, and uses HashMaps to log the user back into the system.
